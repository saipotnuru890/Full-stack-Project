# Simple Flask Registration Application

## ðŸš€ Project Description

This project is a small, functional web application built using the Flask micro-framework. It demonstrates key web development concepts, including front-end form validation, server-side data handling, and template rendering.

The application allows a user to register an account via a simple form.

**Key Features Implemented:**

* **Semantic HTML & Bootstrap 5:** Clean, responsive UI built with Bootstrap components (navbars, forms, buttons).
* **Client-Side Validation (jQuery):** Performs checks for empty fields and minimum password length before submitting data.
* **Server-Side Routing (Flask):** Handles GET requests for the main form and POST requests for processing the data.
* **Jinja2 Templating:** Renders dynamic content (e.g., a personalized success message) passed from the Python backend.
